For the TEP, the sampling frequency of the simulation process is set to 20 per hour. 
Folder 00 is the process data of the normal state, which contains 400 h data, and fokder 01 refers to the process data of fault 01, and the subsequent same. 
For fault data, each .txt file is the 28h of data collected from a single simulation, with the first 8h of normal data followed by 20h of fault data.
The standard data is the normal data, which is used for multiple pattern representation calculation.

For the ASACP, the sampling frequency of the simulation process is set to 60 per min. 
Folder 00 is the process data of the normal state, which contains 35*4 min data, and fokder 01 refers to the process data of fault 01, and the subsequent same. 
For fault data, each .txt file is the whole batch process data collected from a single simulation, with normal data for the first 5 min, then faults are introduced, and fault data for the last 30 min.
The standard data is the normal data, which is used for multiple pattern representation calculation.
