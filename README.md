For the TE process, the sampling frequency of the simulation process is set to 20 per hour. 
Folder 00 is the process data of the normal state, which contains 400 h data, and fokder 01 refers to the process data of fault 01, and the subsequent same. 
For fault data, each .txt file is the 28h of data collected from a single simulation, with the first 8h of normal data followed by 20h of fault data.
The standard data is the normal data, which is used for multiple pattern representation calculation.
